This is what the top of the page should look like with the links working.<br/>
The title heading is Horiseon on the left side and the links are on the right side.<br/>
The links are connected to parts of the portion of the page.  <br/>
The three links are connected to the links to the three main sections of the page which are:<br/>
1. Search Engine Optimization <br/>
2. Online Reputation Management<br/>
3. Social Media Marketing<br/>
The first link did not work because it was a class instead of an id.
